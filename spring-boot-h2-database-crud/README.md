# Spring Boot H2 Database CRUD example: Building Rest API with Spring Data JPA
# Spring Boot JPA with H2 Database Example Project

This is a Spring Boot application demonstrating a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation using Spring Data JPA with H2 in-memory database. It includes a basic model of tutorials, allowing operations like adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting tutorial entries.

## Features

- CRUD operations on tutorial entities.
- In-memory database integration using H2.
- Unit and integration testing of JPA repositories.

## Technology Stack

- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- H2 Database
- JUnit for testing

## Prerequisites

- Java JDK 11 or later
- Maven 3.2+

## Installation and Running the App

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project-repo.git
   cd your-project-repo

## Usage

The application defines several RESTful endpoints for managing tutorials:

- `POST /api/tutorials`: Create a new tutorial.
- `GET /api/tutorials`: Retrieve all tutorials.
- `GET /api/tutorials/{id}`: Retrieve a tutorial by its ID.
- `PUT /api/tutorials/{id}`: Update a tutorial's information by ID.
- `DELETE /api/tutorials/{id}`: Delete a tutorial by ID.
- `DELETE /api/tutorials`: Delete all tutorials.

Access these endpoints through `http://localhost:8080` after starting the application.
